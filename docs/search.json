    "text": "Energy distribution of a Homogeneous Saving Parameter simulation\n\nLater, the model incorporated a saving parameter to emulate saving in economic systems. This essentially allows individuals to save a proportion of their energy/wealth from involvement in a transaction. The animation depicted below is of a simulation in which all agents have the same saving parameter (homogeneous) of 0.5. The consequence of this parameter is that the exponential Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in energy/money is shifted higher, becoming a peaked energy/money distribution with exponential decay on either side, resembling a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in velocity. Evolution of this energy/money distribution is seen in the animation below.\n\n\n\n\n\nGIF showing instant relaxation of energy/money distribution for Pseudo 2D Gas model\n\n\n\n\nThe animation shows an instant relaxation from all individuals having equal energy/money to forming the Maxwell-Boltzmann-like distribution of the averaged final distribution for a simulation with a homogeneous saving parameter of 0.5. The proposed effect of this saving parameter is to limit the amount of energy/money risked by all parties in an interaction, reducing the average amount gained and lost, thus contracting the peak. This effect is more clear in the results of the thesis."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Diamond Light Source Synchrotron\n\n\n\nIn my 4th year of University, I was hired for a competitive undergraduate research position at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron. This international research facility uses a pzarticle accelerator to generate extremely bright X-ray light which can be shone at a variety of things to study their inner workings. Subjects can range from jet turbine blades, to spike proteins on viruses (most famously the COVID virus) revealing their structure and characteristics which is vital for understanding them.\n\n\n\n\nInside the Synchrotron Ring\n\n\n\nDuring my year at the Diamond Light Source, I studied 2D materials such as graphene under ultra-high vacuum. This period required rapid learning of both theory and technical skills applied to complex chemical analytical data including spectroscopy, diffraction, and microscopy for studying materials under ultra-high vacuum. I also developed strong skills in Python, MATLAB and FORTRAN for processing and analysing data from instrumentation.\nDuring intensive, week-long experimental periods, problem solving, critical thinking and the ability to improvise, repair and adjust equipment during strict time constraints were essential skills. Results needed to be assessed correctly, often during strenuous night shifts. The short timeframe allotted also required detailed planning, a focus on efficiency, and constant assessment of feasibility and value of each decision such that the most valuable results could be achieved.\nCollaboration was commonplace in my time there, often supporting international partners, including two groups from the Technical University of Munich. This group work was completed in parallel to an independent project using a high-performance computing cluster to run optimisation calculations. I took great enjoyment from the programming aspects of my work, bug fixing scripts and introducing automation for making data analysis more efficient. One highlight of this was discovering a bug in a fundamental software used in 10s of papers, some of which needed conclusions to be reassessed.\n\n\nUnable to display PDF file. Download instead."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Adsorption structure of iron phthalocyanine and titanyl phthalocyanine on Cu (1 1 1)\n\n\n\n\nThe adsorption structure of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) was studied by a combination of near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and normal incidence X-ray standing waves (NIXSW) technique. The FePc results demonstrate that the molecule adsorbs with the Fe metal centre at an adsorption height of 2.44 ± 0.09 Å, its macrocycle plane mostly parallel with the underlying surface and a single adsorption configuration. However, a small distortion of the isoindole groups, with respect to one another, is required to rationalise the results. The TiOPc results similarly indicate that the macrocycle plane is mostly parallel with the underlying surface up to thick multilayer films, yet, in the monolayer regime, the molecule must adsorb in multiple configurations. These configurations are nominally assigned to a mixture of adsorption configurations with some Ti=O bonds pointing towards the surface, and some pointing away. We determine that, in both configurations, the Ti metal centre sits at a similar adsorption height above the surface of 3.00 ± 0.20 Å.\nThe full paper is available here"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Both pyrene (a) and azupyrene (b) react to form graphene (c) when deposited onto a Cu(111) surface held at 1000 K. Note that pyrene has an alternant topology with four 6-membered rings, while azupyrene possesses a non-alternant topology and consists of two 5-membered and two 7-membered rings.\n\n\n\n\nUltra-high vacuum deposition of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons azupyrene and pyrene onto a Cu(111) surface held at a temperature of 1000 K is herein shown to result in the formation of graphene. The presence of graphene was proven using scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction. The precursors, azupyrene and pyrene, are comparatively large aromatic molecules in contrast to more commonly employed precursors like methane or ethylene. While the formation of the hexagonal graphene lattice could naively be expected when pyrene is used as a precursor, the situation is more complex for azupyrene. In this case, the non-alternant topology of azupyrene with only 5- and 7-membered rings must be altered to form the observed hexagonal graphene lattice. Such a rearrangement, converting a non-alternant topology into an alternant one, is in line with previous reports describing similar topological alterations, including the isomerizWation of molecular azupyrene to pyrene. The thermal synthesis route to graphene, presented here, is achievable at comparatively low temperatures and under ultra-high vacuum conditions, which may enable further investigations of the growth process in a strictly controlled and clean environment that is not accessible with traditional precursors.\nThe full paper is available here"
